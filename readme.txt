== Description ==

Real-time Analytics
We get it: you want your data and you want it now. That's why we show all of your statistics in real-time. You'll never get the same treatment with Google Analytics.

Extremely custom event tracking
Mixpanel makes it dead-simple to track any user action you want. If you have a Facebook game, we can track when users do missions and tell you which ones are the most popular.

A much better Funnel Analysis
Conversion tracking is one of the most important things you can do to improve your business. Mixpanel's Funnel Analysis tool gives you insight into customer behavior as they go through your conversion process.

Visitor Retention
Tracking visitor retention is hard, and Mixpanel is the only service that can do it. We can tell you how long it takes your users to come back again and help you increase engagement.

Macro-level A/B testing
Split testing doesn't always work the way you expect. A change you make on one page can affect how users interact with all the other parts of your site.

Mixpanel can tell you how changing the copy on your front page affects revenue, not just signups.

Platform independence
Mixpanel's REST API makes it possible to send data to us from any platform. Mobile, Facebook, server-side - we can take it all.
